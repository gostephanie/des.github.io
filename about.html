<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<article>
  <p>3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing, where the object is created by laying down
  successive layers of building material until the desired form is reached.
  <br><br>
    An open design 3D printer refers to a 3D printer whose hardware and software information are available to the public, typically under a license.
      The information can be used by anyone to build, modify, or improve the 3D printer. Early 3D printing technologies were used by industry for
      rapid prototyping, by artists, and even medical applications, however the cost and size meant their use was limited.
  <br><br>
    Open design 3D Printing first came in 2008, when Dr. Adrian Bowyer founded the RepRap Project, this was the first open design 3D printer. Its design is distributed
    for free to allow the public to build the machine themselves.</p>
