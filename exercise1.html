      <p> It was only a year ago when I got a mail from the army. I had no choice. I had to leave her behind. <a href="https://atom.io/">"https://atom.io/ </a>

      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>
        Working for my country is not an easy task, it takes blood, sweat, and tears. One thing that has kept me going were her letters that I would get often.
        I just keep on hoping that I would see her again.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>War ended. I made it out alive. As I was taking the train back home to see my woman, a strong feeling suddenly overcomes me. I cant describe what it is but all I know
        was that I can't wait any longer to see her again. As the train arrived from my station, I got off and look around to see if she was there. But she was not. I got back into
        our small house to find the window open... Maybe she is waiting for me inside. As I walked in she was not there. But she left me a letter....She has left me.
        I never thought that love would hurt me more than the war.
